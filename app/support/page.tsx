In the design of tone usage, a very rigorous mathematical order is used. This amazing mathematical order is not boring, but brings us a satisfied smile on our face. With over thirty years of glorious history, we have successively launched Club passive speaker system, MPA speaker system, S3 and S2 compact high pressure level speaker systems, Eurosub speaker system used in large clubs, Odaiko high-end Hi Fi subwoofer, and modern and fashionable MusicMate series speakers. In 2000, the M3-220DT was launched and has been selling well ever since.</p>
