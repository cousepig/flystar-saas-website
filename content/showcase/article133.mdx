The agile little bird (German Syrincs) flies into the luxurious and dignified Hongkun International,

This suddenly brought the solemn Hongkun International to life,

The sound never stops in the ears,

Clear and crisp

Bright

Shen Shen

Expensive

......

Hongkun International instantly exudes a national color and fragrance.

Hongkun International is an international leisure venue that integrates entertainment, fashion, dining, business, and social functions. It is located next to Beijing West Station in Fengtai District, Beijing. Beijing Fengtai is blessed with many historical sites and modern parks, and convenient transportation, making Hongkun International the preferred entertainment destination for people.

The decoration of Hongkun International Hall is luxurious, perfectly integrating Chinese sculpture culture with Western art elements, high-end and exquisite, and magnificent.

Hongkun International has 45 private rooms with different styles indoors. Based on the spatial structure of each room and the principles of spatial acoustics design, the Little Bird team carefully selected high-end entertainment amplification system equipment (Zero120 speakers, ZeroP amplifiers, and Nice 1 microphones) for each private room, turning each private room into a small and optimal performance venue.
