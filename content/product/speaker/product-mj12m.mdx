Multi angle compact structural design, with two fixed angles of 30 ° and 60 °, can be used as the main or auxiliary distributed sound reinforcement, and can also be used as a replay. 12 inch 75 core neodymium magnet design, with a 44 core coaxial installation on the back of the bass for high frequencies, sharing the same neodymium magnet with the bass for efficient and exquisite design.

-Designed primarily for large and medium-sized performing arts, bars, theaters, live performances, and other venues, the surround sound system is designed to provide audio feedback;
-Cooperate with MJ1023, MJ1022 or MJ1239 to form a system;
-Paired with the bass CLUB18W, it can extend the low frequency to 40Hz;
-High sound pressure level and high-definition design.
