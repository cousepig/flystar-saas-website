GP820 is a professional power timing distributor that can divide the input main power into eight power outputs, and can sequentially turn on and off each power supply in chronological order, effectively reducing the impact on the system. It is particularly suitable for use in large-scale audio engineering.

One main circuit input and eight controlled power outputs.
Internal microprocessor control, capable of sequential startup and reverse shutdown, and can be used in cascade with multiple units
Each channel has LED indicators for on/off, which is clear at a glance.
Standard 2U chassis for easy installation.
